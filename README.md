# Galaxy Brain Meme - Frontend Development Practice

![Design preview for the Galaxy Brain Meme coding challenge](/design/Attempt1.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**Hi, my name is LaMonte and thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.**

To do this challenge, I needed a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this Galaxy Brain Meme and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the UI/UX Designers Designed Meme's
- See the `active` card denoted by the blue border and `Most Popular Option` button

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the design located inside the `/design` folder.

The design is in PNG static format. Using PNGs will mean that I needed to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

## Building the project

Below is the process I used:

1. Downloaded the PNG and did a quick markup of the high level elements and containers.
2. Wrote the HTML first from top to bottom, making sure to name my classes in a way that allowed me to know exactly what I was styling in CSS.
3. Linked CSS files, Google Fonts, and any icon libraries I used.
4. When back in from top to bottom with base CSS styling, making sure to reset globals as needed and import fonts.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
6. NOTE: This project is not at all responsive. This is a first attempt, and my focus was on general layout development and not honing exact details.

## Got feedback for me?

I love receiving feedback! I'm always looking to improve my coding skills, so if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email lamonte.fields[at]gmail[dot]com.
